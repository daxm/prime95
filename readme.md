# Welcome to the Prime95 project!

The goal of this project is to allow user's of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) to gather statistics of
their efforts on this project.

**NOTE:  I purposely didn't add the userdata.py file as that is where your username and password should be stored in that
file.  Create a userdata.py file and add the following two lines:**
```
USERNAME = 'your_gimps_username'
PASSWORD = 'your_gimps_password'
```
